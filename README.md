# ReasonML JSON Web Server
This is a boilerplate JSON server built for learning purpose for myself. Uses Cohttp, Lwt, and Yojson.

#### Makefile
`$ make build` 

`$ make run`

`$ make clean`

#### Opam dependencies
After running
`$ opam install jbuilder reason cohttp lwt yjson`

You should be set. If issues arise `$ opam switch 4.02.3`
